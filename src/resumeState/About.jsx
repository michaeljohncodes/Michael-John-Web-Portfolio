          A Full-Stack Web Developer currently focused in Front-End Web
          development, a Creative Visual Storyteller, and Business Strategist
          with a knack for turning ideas into impactful digital and visual
          experiences.
          <br />
          <br /> With hands-on expertise in React.js, JavaScript and Tailwind
          CSS, I build responsive, user-friendly web solutions that solve
          problems and connect brands with their audiences.
          <br />
          <br /> My creative side shines through years of professional
          photography, cinematography, and content production, capturing moments
          that inspire and sell.
          <br />
          <br /> Over the years, I've worked with industry-leading brands,
          documented high-profile launches like the iPhone series and GAC Motors
          in Nigeria, and crafted digital campaigns that boost engagement and
          sales.
          <br />
          <br /> My background in sales, marketing, and operations management
          gives me a unique edge â€” I understand both the creative process and
          the business strategy behind every successful project.
          <br />
          <br /> Whether I'm coding a seamless user interface or directing a
          visual campaign, my goal is simple: to deliver results that not only
          look good but also work brilliantly.
